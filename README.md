# ecocalc
This is a command-line based calculator that I had written in 2017 and
re-written in 2020. Its intention is that you can specify a target product in
your game economy after having specified specific recipes (e.g., for crafting)
and it will show you exactly how many of which part you need to perform that.

Typical games this works for is
[Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/489830/),
[Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/) or
[Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/). All of which are fantastic
games, by the way.

It can also calculate rate-based, e.g., if you want the exact amount of
smelters that is needed to smelt iron ore of a specific mine (and of course
much more complicated things). 

Another feature that the original calculator had (that is still missing in the
rewrite) is to identify profitable loops in the economy. E.g., buy product X
and Y for €100, craft product Z, sell Z for €200.
